            You are a retired wizard.  Switching hats, you are now enjoying life on the countryside as a cowboy.  However, your sheep keep escaping.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can teleport the sheep into the gated area by booping them. Move the sheep into that area before the time runs out and they dissapear forever...
        </p>
        <p>
            Good Luck!
